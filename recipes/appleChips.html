    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These apple chips with cinnamon will disappear almost as quickly as you make them! They're perfect as a healthy snack and easy to take on the road. The secret is to bake them at a very low temperature for a long time, dehydrating the apples.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Golden Delicious apples, cored and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Arrange apple slices in a single layer on a metal baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Mix together sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl; sprinkle over apple slices.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until apples are dried and edges curl, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Use a metal spatula to transfer chips to a wire rack until cool and crispy.</li>
        <li>You are all done!</li>
    </ol>
